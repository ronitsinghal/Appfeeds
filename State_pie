    "description": "In poll-bound Delhi assembly elections, a three-way battle is being fought among AAP led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, BJP and Congress. For a clear victory, any party needs to win at least 36 seats in the 70-seat Delhi assembly. In the previous election, AAP won 67 seats.\nAfter failing to expand beyond Delhi and further losing its gains in Punjab in the May 2019 Lok Sabha elections, a defeat for AAP in the current election will be a severe setback. But as of now, it enjoys frontrunner status as Kejirwal engages in a major public outreach over populist initiatives and claims of a significant improvement in areas like education.\nAAP will hope differentiations between state and national polls will work in its favour. Kejriwal has also changed his earlier tactic of attacking PM Narendra Modi and directly clashing with the Centre over a range of issues.\nBJP, meanwhile, hopes that AAP will not have the benefit of the extraordinary surge that powered it to 67 seats in 2015. The party is reaching out to unauthorised colonies and slums with its regularisation plans along with the promise of faster development.\nCongress is the third player in the game. There is, however, concern over its organisational health post the death of Sheila Dikshit, who was a popular chief minister for three consecutive terms. Also, while in the Lok Sabha polls, it was seen as a contender at the Centre by anti-BJP voters, the case might be different in the state elections where both Congress and AAP are looking to consolidate the minority vote."
